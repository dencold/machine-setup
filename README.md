# machine-setup
Setup scripts for initializing a new machine.

These are one-time scripts that are in charge of setting defaults and installing helpful utilities on machines that I use for development. Currently, we have two targets:

* Mac OSX
* Linux (Arch)

The usage here is to run on a new machine once. It should *not* be used for profile/environment settings. Those belong in the dotfiles repository. Rather, this is used for installing things like homebrew for the Mac and changing system font on Linux. This should be done once, not everytime I shell into the machine.
